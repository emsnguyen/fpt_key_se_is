Short Answer Questions
 
181. What is a corporation? Identify the key advantages and disadvantages of corporations. 
A corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its owners. Ownership of corporations is represented by shares of stock. Owners of the stock are called shareholders or stockholders. Advantages of corporations include: limited liability of stockholders, ease of ownership transfer, continuous life, lack of mutual agency for stockholders, and ease of capital accumulation. Two disadvantages of corporations are: government regulation and double taxation.

182. What are the rights generally granted to common stockholders? 
Common stockholders generally have the right to vote at stockholders' meetings, sell or otherwise dispose of their stock, receive the same dividend, if any on each common share, and share in any assets remaining after creditors are paid when and if the corporation is liquidated. Stockholders generally also have a preemptive right, which is the right to purchase their proportional share of any common stock later issued by the corporation.

183. Identify and describe the two main components of stockholders' equity. 
Stockholders' equity consists of two main parts, paid-in capital and retained earnings. Paid-in capital consists of funds raised by the issuance of stock, either common or preferred. Paid-in capital is the total amount of cash and other assets the corporation receives in exchange for stock. Paid-in capital in excess of par value represents the amount a corporation receives from issuing stock when the market value exceeds the par value of the stock. Retained earnings is the cumulative net income and loss retained by the corporation less any dividends declared.

184. Identify and discuss the key differences between common and preferred stock. 
Both common and preferred stock can represent shares of ownership in a corporation. Preferred stock has a priority (senior) status relative to common stock in one or more areas. The most common preference items are dividends and distribution of assets in the event of liquidation. When cash or liquidating dividends are declared, preferred stockholders receive them before common stockholders. Preferred shareholders usually do not have the voting rights that are assigned to common shareholders. Preferred stock may be convertible to common stock. Preferred stock also may be subject to a call provision which allows the corporation to buy back the preferred stock under specified conditions.

185. Explain the composition of retained earnings and identify the special items that are reported in it. 
Retained earnings generally consists of a company's cumulative net income less any net losses and dividends declared since its inception. Within retained earnings, companies may report restricted retained earnings, appropriated retained earnings, or prior period adjustments. Restrictions of retained earnings may be statutory or contractual. Many states restrict treasury stock purchases to the amount of retained earnings. Appropriated retained earnings refer to a voluntary transfer of amounts from Retained Earnings to Appropriated Retained Earnings to inform users of special activities that require funds. Prior period adjustments are corrections of errors in prior periods' financial statements. These should be differentiated from changes in accounting estimates, which are not considered errors and are not reported as prior period adjustments.

186. Explain stock options and their effect on the company. 
Stock options are the rights to purchase common stock at a fixed price over a specified period. As the stock's price rises above the fixed price, the option's value increases. As a general rule, stock options motivate managers and employees to (1) focus on company performance, (2) take a long-term perspective, and (3) remain with the company. A stock option is like having an investment with no risk.

187. Explain how to calculate the price-earnings ratio and describe how it is used in analysis of a company's financial condition and performance. 
The price-earnings ratio of a common stock is computed by dividing the stock's market value per share by its earnings per share. The price-earnings ratio represents the stock market's expectations of a company's future performance. Some analysts view a high PE (greater than 20 to 25, for instance) ratio as an indication that a stock is overvalued. A low ratio (less than 5 to 8) may indicate that a stock is undervalued.

188. Explain how to compute dividend yield and discuss how it is used in analysis of a company's financial condition. 
Dividend yield is the ratio of annual cash dividends per share divided by the market value per share of stock. The resulting dividend yield represents the percent of cash return investors receive from an investment in a company's stock. Dividend yield can be used to identify whether a stock is an income stock or a growth stock. Companies that pay large dividends on a regular basis are income stocks. Companies that distribute little or no cash but use the cash to finance expansion are known as growth stocks.

189. Explain how to compute book value per share and discuss how it can be used to analyze the financial condition of a corporation. 
Book value per share is calculated by dividing the stockholders' equity applicable to common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value per share reflects value per share if a company were liquidated at balance sheet amounts. Book value per share is the starting point in many stock valuation models, merger negotiation, price setting for public utilities and loan contracts. Its main limitation is the potential difference between recorded value and market value for assets.

190. Explain the preparation of journal entries to record the issuance of par value, stated value, and no-par value common stock. 
When stock is issued for cash, cash is debited. If the stock is issued for assets other than cash, those assets are debited for their market value. If the stock is par value stock, Common Stock is credited for the par value of the stock, and any amounts over the par value are credited to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value, Common Stock. If the stock is stated value stock, Common Stock is credited for the stated value, and any additional amounts are credited to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Stated Value, Common Stock. If the stock is no-par, all amounts received are credited to Common Stock.

192. What is a stock split? How is a stock split different from a stock dividend? 
A stock split is the distribution of additional shares to stockholders according to their present ownership. When a stock split occurs, the corporation "calls in" its outstanding shares and issues more that one new share in exchange for each old share. Stock splits reduce the par or stated value per share. Total paid-in capital, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are unchanged by stock splits. Stock dividends are distributions of additional shares of the corporation's own stock to its stockholders without the receipt of any payment in return. A stock dividend does not change the par or stated value per share. Total paid-in capital is increased, total retained earnings is decreased from a stock dividend, but total stockholders' equity is unchanged from a stock dividend.

193. Explain the difference between a large stock dividend and a small stock dividend. In addition, explain how to record these two types of stock dividends. 
A large stock dividend is a distribution of more than 25% of previously outstanding shares. A large stock dividend is recorded by capitalizing retained earnings for an amount equal to the par or stated value of the shares. A small stock dividend is a distribution of less than or equal to 25% of the previously outstanding shares. A small stock dividend is recorded by capitalizing retained earnings for an amount equal to the market value of the shares to be distributed.

195. What is treasury stock? How is the purchase and sale of treasury stock recorded? 
Treasury stock is the company's own issued shares that it reacquires. The cost of these shares is debited to Treasury Stock. Treasury Stock is a contra equity account and the balance is subtracted from Stockholders' Equity on the balance sheet. If the treasury stock is reissued, any proceeds in excess of the purchase price are credited to the Paid-in Capital, Treasury Stock account. If the proceeds are less than the purchase price then the deficit is debited to Paid-in Capital, Treasury Stock (provided a balance exists–if it does not, or the balance is driven to zero, then Retained Earnings is debited).

196. How is the retirement of stock recorded? 
When a company's own stock is retired, all paid-in capital amounts related to the retired shares are removed. If the purchase price exceeds the net amount removed from the paid-in capital, the difference is debited to Retained Earnings. If the purchase price is less than the net amount removed from the paid-in capital, the difference is credited to Paid-in Capital from Retirement of Stock.

Short Answer Questions
 
141. What is a bond? Identify and discuss the different types of bonds. 
A bond is a written promise to pay an amount identified as the par value of the bond along with interest at a stated rate. Bonds can be issued by companies or governments. Bonds are usually issued in denominations of $1,000. Bonds can be secured or unsecured. Secured bonds are backed by collateral or assets of the issuer. Bonds can mature in different ways. Serial bonds mature at different points in time, while term bonds mature at a single date. Registered bonds are payable to a specific bondholder, while bearer bonds are payable to whoever holds the bonds. Convertible bonds may be exchanged by bondholders for shares of the issuing company's stock. Callable bonds can be retired prior to the maturity date by the issuer.

142. Describe installment notes and the way in which installment notes are paid. 
Installment notes are agreements to repay borrowed amounts over several periods through a series of payments. The most common type of note requires an equal payment which is allocated between principal and interest. With equal total payments, the cash payment remains constant over the life of the note while the amount applied to principal increases over time and the amount of interest expense decreases over time.

143. On January 1, 2009 a company borrowed $70,000 cash by signing a 9% installment note that is to be repaid with 4 annual year-end payments of $21,607. While the amount borrowed equals $70,000, the total payments on this note amount to $86,428. Explain. 
Payments on an installment note include payments toward the amount borrowed (principal) as well as accrued interest on the loan. The $16,428 difference between the amount borrowed and the amount repaid represents interest and should be treated as an expense by the company borrowing the funds.

144. Explain the present value concept as it applies to long term liabilities. 
The basic present value concept is that cash paid or received in the future has less value than the same amount of cash paid or received today. If a company plans to borrow money, payable in the future, the amount of cash received today equals the present value of the future payment, discounted at the loan's interest rate.

146. What is a lease? Explain the difference between an operating lease and a capital lease. 
A lease is a contractual agreement between a lessor (asset owner) and a lessee (asset renter) that grants the lessee the right to use the asset for a period of time in return for cash rent payments. Operating leases are short-term or cancelable leases in which the lessor retains the risks and rewards of ownership. The lessee in an operating lease does not report the leased item as an asset or a liability. The cash payments are recorded as rent expense. Capital leases are long-term or noncancelable leases by which the lessor transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. The lessee records the leased item as its own asset with a lease liability at the start of the lease term. Each payment includes interest expense plus a payment on the lease liability. The lessee records depreciation expense on the leased asset.

148. A corporation plans to invest $1 million in oil exploration. The corporation is considering two plans to raise the money. Under Plan #1, bonds with a contract rate of interest of 6% would be issued. Under Plan #2, additional shares of common stock would be issued at $20 per share. The corporation currently has 300,000 shares of stock outstanding, and it expects to earn $700,000 per year before bond interest and income taxes. The net income and return on investment for both plans is shown below: 

   

Comment on the relative effects of each alternative, including when one form of financing is preferred to another. 
Plan #1 provides a slightly higher return on equity, but it creates additional risk. If the corporation has a bad year and does not earn sufficient net income, it will still be obligated to pay out the $60,000 interest cost under Plan #1. On the other hand, Plan #2 does not require any periodic cash outflows. However, Plan #2 does dilute ownership through the issuance of additional shares. In summary, if the issuer expects to earn high returns with the funds, then bond financing is preferred. If the issuer expects marginal and/or risky returns, then stock financing is preferred.

149. Describe the journal entries required to record the issuance of bonds and the payment of bond interest. 
The journal entry to record bond issuance includes a debit to Cash for the amount of the proceeds and a credit to Bonds Payable for the amount of the par value of the bonds. Proceeds in excess of par value are credited to Premium on Bonds Payable. If the proceeds are less than the par value then the Discount on Bonds Payable is debited. At the time of each interest payment, the Interest Expense account is debited and the Cash account is credited for the amount of the stated interest. Amortization of a premium decreases Interest Expense while amortization of a discount increases it.

150. Explain the amortization of a bond discount. Identify and describe the amortization methods available. 
A bond discount occurs when bonds are sold for less than their par value. The discount represents additional interest over the life of the bond (the full par value must be paid to bondholders at maturity). The amount of the bond discount is amortized over the life of the bond. One method of amortizing the bond discount is the straight-line method. The amount of discount amortized each period is the original discount divided by the number of interest periods. Bond interest expense each period is the cash interest payment plus the discount amortized. Another method is the effective interest method. In this case the bond interest expense is calculated by multiplying the bonds' beginning-of-the-period carrying value by the market interest rate for the bond at issuance.

151. Explain how to record the issuance and sale of a bond between interest payment dates. 
If a bond is issued at a date other than an interest payment date, the buyers normally pay the issuer the purchase price plus any interest accrued since the prior interest date. The amount debited to cash is the bond selling price plus interest accrued since the prior interest date. Bonds Payable is credited for the par value of the bond and Interest Payable is credited for the amount of the accrued interest. If there is a premium on the bond, it is credited. A discount on the bond is debited. The accrued interest is repaid to the buyers on the next interest payment date.

152. Explain the accounting procedures when a bond's interest period does not coincide with the issuer's accounting period. 
If the bond's interest period does not coincide with the issuer's accounting period, interest must be accrued. Bond Interest Expense is debited, Interest Payable is credited. If there is a bond premium or discount, it must be amortized at the time of the interest's accrual. If there is a premium on the bond, Premium on Bonds Payable must be debited. If there is a discount on the bond, Discount on Bonds Payable is credited.

153. How are bond issue prices determined? 
The issue price of bonds is found by computing the present value of the bonds' cash payments, discounted at the bond's market rate. If the bond's market rate is greater than the bond's coupon rate, the bond will sell at a discount. If the bond's market rate is less than the bond's coupon rate, the bond will sell at a premium.

154. Explain the amortization of a bond premium. Identify and describe the amortization methods available. 
A bond premium occurs when bonds are sold for more than their par value. The bond premium represents a reduction in the amount of interest owed over the life of the bond. A bond premium is amortized over the life of the bond. One method of amortizing the bond premium is the straight-line method. The premium amortized each period is the original premium divided by the number of interest periods. Bond interest expense each period is the cash interest payment less the premium amortized. Another method is the effective interest method. In this case the bond interest expense is calculated by multiplying the bonds' beginning-of-the-period carrying value by the market interest rate for the bonds at issuance.

155. What are methods that a company may use to retire its bonds? 
The company can retire the bonds at their scheduled maturity date. They can also retire the bonds before maturity by either exercising a call option or purchasing them in the open market. Sometimes the bond indenture will give the issuer an option to call the bonds before their maturity date by paying the par value plus a call premium to the bondholder. If the call price or the market price paid is above the carrying value of the bonds, the issuer will record a loss on the early retirement. If the call price or the market price paid is below the carrying value of the bonds, the issuer will record a gain on the early retirement. A bond issuer can also buy the bonds in the open market at the current market price. Another way the bonds can be retired is to convert them to stock. In this method, the bonds' carrying value is transferred to equity and there is no gain or loss on the conversion.

At issuance, the proceeds from a note must be recognized in the appropriate asset account and the debt must be recognized as a note payable. Each interest payment (or interest plus principal payment) is recorded with a debit to Interest Expense (and a debit to Notes Payable when principal is involved) and a credit to Cash. The retirement of a note is recognized with a debit to Notes Payable and a credit to Cash (or other asset).

136. Describe how to account for and report on contingent liabilities. 
If an uncertain obligation depends on a probable future event arising from a past transaction and the amount is reasonably estimated, the payment is recorded as a liability. If the future event is remote, the item is not recorded or disclosed. If the future event is reasonably possible, the information about the contingent liability is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

139. Explain how to calculate times interest earned. Explain how it is used to analyze a company's risk. 
The times interest earned ratio is calculated by dividing a company's net income before interest expense and income taxes by interest expense. The ratio reflects a company's ability to pay interest and earn a profit for its owners against declines in sales. A low ratio indicates that the default risk on liabilities is high.

140. What is a short-term note payable? Explain the accounting issues related to notes payable. 
A note payable is a written promise to pay a specified amount on a definite future date within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer. Short-term notes payable are negotiable, and can be transferred from party to party. Notes payable must be recorded on the date they are signed. When the note is paid, interest is paid in addition to the principal amount. If the end of the accounting period occurs between the signing of a note payable and its maturity date, the matching principle requires that accrued but unpaid interest be recorded.

141. Explain the responsibilities of and the accounting by employers for employee payroll deductions. 
Employers are responsible for collecting employee federal income taxes and employee social security and Medicare taxes from employees. The employers record these amounts as current liabilities and send the amounts to the federal government to discharge their obligation. Payroll deductions can also include nontax items such as insurance and contributions to retirement plans. All payroll deductions are considered to be liabilities until the amounts are transmitted to the designated organization.

142. Identify and explain the types of employer payroll taxes. 
Employers are required to make matching contributions for the amount of FICA taxes for Social Security and Medicare that are withheld from employees' pay. In addition, employers must contribute to both federal and state unemployment compensation programs. The federal program is called FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) and the state programs are called SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act). The amount of unemployment tax that employers pay is based on their merit rating. The merit rating reflects a company's stability or instability in employing workers.

143. What are estimated liabilities? Cite at least two examples and explain why they are classified as estimated liabilities. 
Estimated liabilities are known obligations of an uncertain amount that can be estimated. Warranties, income taxes, and employee benefits are common types of estimated liabilities. Warranties are estimated liabilities because the obligation to repair defective merchandise exists at the time of sale. The amount of potential warranty work can be estimated based on past sales. Employee benefits are generated as employees earn their wages. Amounts can be estimated based on contractual or past experience.

72. On December 31 of the current year, Hewett Company reported an ending inventory balance of $215,000. The following additional information is also available: 
· Hewett sold goods costing $38,000 to Trump Enterprises on December 28 and shipped the goods on that date with shipping terms of FOB shipping point. The goods were not included in the ending inventory amount of $215,000 because they were not in Hewett's warehouse.
· Hewett purchased goods costing $44,000 on December 29. The goods were shipped FOB destination and were received by Hewett on January 2 of the following year. The shipment was a rush order that was supposed to arrive by December 31. These goods were included in the ending inventory balance of $215,000.
· Hewett's ending inventory balance of $215,000 included $15,000 of goods being held on consignment from Rumsfeld Company. (Hewett Company is the consignee.)
· Hewett's ending inventory balance of $215,000 did not include goods costing $95,000 that were shipped to Hewett on December 27 with shipping terms of FOB destination and were still in transit at year-end.
Based on the above information, the correct balance for ending inventory on December 31 is: 
A. $194,000
B. $209,000
C. $200,000
D. $171,000
E. $156,000
Start with beginning inventory of $215,000. The information in the first bullet point was handled correctly, although the explanation for why is incorrect. No adjustment. For the second bullet point, the $44,000 of goods should not have been included in ending inventory since the goods were shipped FOB destination. Subtract $44,000. For the third bullet point, ending inventory should not include goods held on consignment from another company. Subtract $15,000. The information in the fourth bullet point was handled correctly.
No adjustment. $215,000 - $44,000 - $15,000 = $156,000.

· The ending inventory balance of $412,000 included $22,000 of office supplies that were stored in the warehouse and were to be used by the company's supervisors and managers during the coming year.
· The ending inventory balance of $412,000 did not include goods costing $48,000 that were purchased by Gotham on December 28 and shipped FOB destination on that date. Gotham did not receive the goods until January 2 of the following year.
· The ending inventory balance of $412,000 included damaged goods at their original cost of $38,000. The net realizable value of the damaged goods was $10,000.
· The ending inventory balance of $412,000 included $43,000 of consigned inventory for which Gotham was the consignee.
Based on this information, the correct balance for ending inventory on December 31 is: 
A. $247,000
B. $341,000
C. $362,000
D. $309,000
E. $319,000
Start with beginning inventory of $412,000. The information in the first bullet point was handled correctly since inventory should include consigned goods for which the subject company is the consignor. No adjustment. With respect to the second bullet point, inventory should not include office supplies held for use. Subtract $22,000. The information in the third bullet point was handled correctly since inventory should not include goods shipped FOB destination that have not yet been received by the buyer. With respect to the fourth bullet point, damaged goods should not be included in inventory at their original cost if the net realizable value is materially below cost. Subtract $28,000 ($38,000 - $10,000). With respect to the fifth bullet point, inventory should not include the value of consigned inventory for which the subject company is the consignee. Subtract $43,000. Thus, ending inventory should be $412,000 - $22,000 - $28,000 - $43,000 = $319,000.

89. Thelma Company reported cost of goods sold for Year 1 and Year 2 as follows: 

   

Thelma Company made two errors: 1) ending inventory at the end of Year 1 was understated by $15,000 and 2) ending inventory at the end of Year 2 was overstated by $6,000. Given this information, the correct cost of goods sold figure for Year 2 would be: 
A. $291,000
B. $276,000
C. $264,000
D. $285,000
E. $249,000
If ending inventory for Year 1 was reported at $130,000 but was understated by $15,000, the correct ending inventory figure for Year 1 was $145,000. That amount becomes the beginning inventory for Year 2. Add to that amount the $275,000 of cost of goods purchased in Year 2 and you get cost of goods available for sale of $420,000. Finally, the reported ending inventory figure for Year 2 of $135,000 was overstated by $6,000. Thus, the correct ending inventory figure for Year 2 was $129,000. Subtracting ending inventory of $129,000 from cost of goods available for sale of $420,000 yields cost of goods sold of $291,000.

The beginning inventory balance for Year 1 is correct. The ending inventory balance for Year 2 is also correct. However, the ending inventory figure for Year 1 was overstated by $20,000. Given this information, the correct gross profit figures for Year 1 and Year 2 would be: 
A. $129,000 for Year 1 and $256,000 for Year 2.
B. $281,000 for Year 1 and $274,000 for Year 2.
C. $129,000 for Year 1 and $276,000 for Year 2.
D. $169,000 for Year 1 and $236,000 for Year 2.
E. $169,000 for Year 1 and $276,000 for Year 2.
If ending inventory of $144,000 for Year 1 were overstated by $20,000, the correct amount of ending inventory was $124,000. As a result, cost of goods sold for Year 1 was not $261,000 as reported, but rather $281,000. Thus, gross profit for Year 1 was $129,000 (Sales of $410,000 - Cost of Goods Sold of $281,000). The adjusted ending inventory balance for Year 1 ($124,000) becomes the beginning inventory balance for Year 2. Adding to that figure the $302,000 of purchases during the year and you get cost of goods available for sale of $426,000. If we then subtract the $152,000 of ending inventory for Year 2, we get cost of goods sold in Year 2 of $274,000. Accordingly, gross profit for Year 2 is $276,000 (Sales of $550,000 - Cost of Goods Sold of $274,000).

132. Identify the items that are included in merchandise inventory. (In your answer address the special situations of goods in transit, consigned goods, and damaged goods.) 
Merchandise inventory consists of goods owned by a company and held for resale. Three special cases involving ownership decisions are goods in transit, consigned goods, and damaged goods. Goods in transit are included in the inventory of the company that owns the goods. Consigned goods are included in the inventory of the consignor. Damaged goods are valued at net realizable value.

135. Explain the effects of inventory valuation methods on the cost of ending inventory, income, and income taxes. 
The specific identification method exactly identifies the costs of the inventory items sold. The weighted average method smooths out changes in costs by "averaging" inventory costs. However, LIFO and FIFO provide different amounts in periods of rising or falling costs. For example, in periods of rising costs, LIFO provides a lower income and thus lower taxes. In periods of falling costs, LIFO provides a higher income and thus higher taxes. FIFO calculations provide both higher income and taxes in periods of rising costs and lower income and taxes in periods of declining costs.

136. How do the consistency concept and the full disclosure principle affect inventory valuation? 
The consistency concept requires that companies use the same accounting method for inventory valuation from period to period so that the financial statements are comparable across periods. The only exception is when a change from one method to another will improve its financial reporting. The consistency principle does not require a company to use one inventory valuation method for all categories of inventory.
If a company does change its inventory valuation method, the full disclosure principle requires that the notes to the financial statements report the type of change, its justification, and its effect on net income.

137. What is the effect of an error in the ending inventory balance on the income statement? 
An inventory error causes misstatements in cost of good sold, gross profit, net income, current assets, and equity. It also causes misstatements in the next period's cost of goods sold and net income. However, the inventory error is said to be self-correcting because the error in the first period is offset by the error in the second period

138. Explain how the inventory turnover ratio and the days' sales in inventory ratio are used to evaluate inventory management. 
A merchandiser's ability to pay its short term obligations depends, among other factors, on how quickly it sells its merchandise inventory. The inventory turnover ratio reveals how many times a company turns over (sells) its inventory during a period. A low ratio compared to competitors suggests the company may be holding more inventory than necessary to support its sales volume. On the other hand, a ratio that is too high compared to competitors may suggest that the inventory level is too low and customers may have to back order merchandise.
The days' sales in inventory ratio helps to better interpret inventory turnover. It can be interpreted as the number of days one can sell from inventory if no new items are purchased, and can be viewed as a measure of the buffer against out-of-stock inventory.

139. Identify and describe the four inventory valuation methods. 
The specific identification method assigns costs to each inventory item based on specific invoice costs. The weighted average method assigns costs by using the total balance in inventory and dividing it by the number of units to arrive at a cost per unit at each sale. This cost per unit is then multiplied by the number of units in ending inventory. The first-in-first-out method assigns cost to items sold assuming that the first units purchased are the first to be sold. The last-in-first out method assumes that the last units purchased are the first to be sold.

140. Explain why the lower of cost or market rule is used to value inventory. 
The concept of conservatism requires that if there is more than one estimate of the value of an asset, then the lower of the two should be used. The lower of cost or market rule compares the acquisition cost of inventory with the current replacement cost. The lower of these two values is then selected as the amount to be reported.

Instead, a physical count of inventory at the end of the accounting period is used to determine the amount of inventory sold. Certain costs of inventory such as transportation-in, purchases discounts, and purchases returns and allowances are recorded in separate accounts. These separate accounts are then used to help compute inventory at the end of the period.

142. Explain the difference between the retail inventory method and gross profit inventory method for valuing inventory. 
The retail method is generally used to prepare interim statements. It uses the cost to retail ratio to give an estimated ending inventory at cost. The gross profit method is typically used to reconstruct the value of lost, stolen, or destroyed inventory. It uses the (historical) gross profit ratio to estimate cost of goods sold and the value of ending inventory.

143. The opening story for Chapter 6 indicated that Jacquelyn Tran initially struggled with inventory and sales when the business was first opened. The major challenge was maintaining appropriate levels of inventories while controlling costs. What is meant by this statement? 
Any entrepreneur who sells inventory must constantly balance the need to have adequate inventory available to meet customers' demands while also minimizing the amount of investment in inventory. Maintaining too little inventory can result in stock-outs (lost sales due to a lack of available inventory) but maintaining too much inventory wastes the company's resources (by requiring funds be invested in inventory and not in other more productive assets). Thus, businesses must constantly balance the need to keep sufficient inventory available to meet demand while also trying to minimize the funds invested in inventory. By applying modern inventory management, Jacquelyn learned how to account for purchases and sales and to keep customers happy by stocking products that customers demanded.

Problems
 
144. Monitor Company uses the LIFO method for valuing its ending inventory. The following financial statement information is available for its first year of operation: 

   

Monitor's ending inventory using the LIFO method was $8,200. Monitor's accountant determined that had the company used FIFO, the ending inventory would have been $8,500.

a. Determine what the income before taxes would have been, had Monitor used the FIFO method of inventory valuation instead of LIFO.
b. What would be the difference in income taxes between LIFO and FIFO, assuming a 30% tax rate?
c. If Monitor wanted to lower the amount of income taxes to be paid, which method would it choose? 
a. If ending inventory is $300 higher using FIFO ($8,500 - $8,200), then the cost of goods sold would be $300 lower, gross profit $300 higher, and income before taxes would be $300 higher. Therefore, income before taxes would be $14,000 + $300 = $14,300.
b. 
   

Income taxes would be $90 higher using FIFO than LIFO.
c. Monitor would choose the LIFO method because it results in lower income taxes.

192. The inventory manager's compensation includes a bonus plan based on gross profit. You discover that the inventory manager has knowingly overstated ending inventory by $2 million. What effect does this error have on the financial statements of the company and specifically gross profit? Why would the manager knowingly overstate ending inventory? Would this be considered an ethics violation? 
By overstating ending inventory, the cost of goods sold is understated, causing the gross profit to be overstated and net income to be overstated. By overstating the gross profit, this would increase the manager's bonus. The assets and equity would also be overstated. Since the manager's bonus is based on gross profit, the error would result in a larger bonus since gross profit would be overstated. Yes, this would be considered an ethics violation since the manager intentionally overstated ending inventory and the financial statements would contain errors that could affect decisions made by the users of the financial statements.

194. Advances in technology have greatly reduced the cost of a perpetual inventory system. What advantages does a perpetual inventory system have over periodic? 
The perpetual inventory system updates the inventory balance as transactions affecting inventory occur, the balance is increased for purchases and decreased for sales. The subsidiary ledger also enables companies to get detailed records for each inventory item without a lot of extra effort. Knowing the exact amount of inventory may avoid the risk of lost sales and also help management reduce the level of inventory, thereby increasing the inventory turnover and decreasing the required number of days' sales in inventory. The reduced level of inventory also reduces costs. Many companies are now asking whether they can afford not to have a perpetual inventory system because timely access to inventory information is a competitive advantage.

195.  Fun Land Toy Stores has taken a physical count of its inventory at January 31, its fiscal year-end. After reviewing the accounting records and documentation, the following items have been discovered: (a) An invoice from Fleck Co. indicates that $30,000 of toys were shipped to Fun Land on January 27, terms FOB shipping point. The toys and invoice did not arrive at Fun Land until February 2 and were not included in the physical count. (b) An invoice from Grande indicates that $8,000 of toys were shipped to Fun Land on January 29, terms FOB destination. The toys and invoice did not arrive at Fun Land until February 2 and were not included in the physical count. The physical count and cost assignment on January 31 prior to these two items is $440,000. The cost of goods sold for Fun Land is $2,100,000.
 1. Calculate the amount that should be reported as ending inventory for Fun Land.
 2. Calculate the days' sales in inventory before and after the appropriate adjustments for inventory.  
 1. The ending inventory should be adjusted to $470,000. Only the $30,000 invoice needs to be added since it was shipped FOB shipping point, the owner (Fun Land) should include the inventory in the ending balance. ($440,000 + $30,000 = $470,000)
2. Before adjustment: 440,000/2,100,000 * 365 = 76.5 days
After adjustment: 470,000/2,100,000 * 365 = 81.7 days

140. What is the acid-test ratio? How does it measure a company's liquidity? 
The acid-test ratio is calculated by dividing quick assets (cash, current receivables, and short-term investments) by current liabilities. The acid-test measures the ability of a firm to pay its current liabilities. As a rule of thumb an acid test ratio less than 1 means that current liabilities exceed quick assets and the company is likely to face near-term liquidity problems.

The gross margin ratio is calculated by dividing gross margin (or net sales less cost of goods sold) by net sales. The gross margin ratio measures a firm's profitability in selling its inventory. The gross margin must be large enough to cover operating expenses and provide sufficient net income to the owner(s).

142. What does FOB stand for? Differentiate between FOB shipping point (or FOB factory) and FOB destination. 
FOB stands for free on board. If goods are shipped FOB shipping point, ownership transfers to the buyer when the goods depart the seller's place of business, and the seller records revenue at that time. The buyer is then responsible for paying shipping costs and bearing the risk of damage or loss when goods are in transit.
If goods are shipped FOB destination, ownership transfers to the buyer when the goods arrive at the buyer's place of business. The seller is responsible for paying shipping costs and bears the risk of damage or loss in transit. The seller does not record revenue until the goods arrive at the destination because the transaction is not complete before that point.

143. Describe the recording process (including costs) for purchasing merchandise inventory using a perpetual inventory system. 
Purchases, net of trade discounts, are added (debited) to the Merchandise Inventory account. Purchases discounts and purchases returns and allowances are subtracted (credited) from Merchandise Inventory. Transportation-in costs are added (debited) to Merchandise Inventory. The accounting procedures are recorded each time merchandise purchases occur. In this way, merchandise inventory reflects all net purchases on a timely basis.

144. Describe the recording process (including costs) for sales of merchandise inventory using a perpetual inventory system. 
Sales are recorded at list price less any trade discounts. The cost of items sold is transferred from Merchandise Inventory to Cost of Goods Sold. Refunds or credits for returned merchandise are recorded (debited) to Sales Returns and Allowances. When cash discounts from the sales price are taken, the seller records (debits) the amount of the discounts to Sales Discounts. These accounting processes are recorded each time sales transactions occur. In this way, merchandise inventory, cost of sales, sales and receivables (or cash) reflect sales transactions on a timely basis.

146. How do closing entries for a merchandising company that uses the perpetual inventory system differ from the closing entries for a service company? 
Merchandising companies have some accounts that must be closed that service companies do not have. Generally, the revenue account for merchandising companies is called Sales rather than Fees Earned. It is closed with a debit, as are other revenues. Service companies do not have Sales Discounts, Sales Returns and Allowances, and Cost of Goods Sold that all appear in the accounts of merchandising companies. Each of these accounts must be closed with a credit. The remaining closing entries – closing Income Summary to Owner's Capital, and closing Withdrawals to Owner's Capital – are identical whether the firm is a merchandising firm or a service firm.

150. In order to be successful, Joel Boblit of BigBadToyStore knew that he had to effectively track merchandising activities. Describe how using an inventory management system improved control over inventory and management of the business. 
Tracking merchandise activities was necessary to set prices and to mange discounts, allowances and returns of both sales and purchases. A perpetual inventory system enabled Joel to order the right type and amounts of inventory to meet customer demand and use space more efficiently. By ordering and stocking the correct amount of inventory, this reduces the costs of out-of-stock and excess inventory.

Assuming the asset's salvage value is $2,000, what will be the amount of accumulated depreciation on this asset on December 31, 2011? 
A. $5,000.00
B. $4,166.67

85. The following information is available on a depreciable asset owned by First Bank & Trust: 

   

The asset's book value is $70,000 on October 1, 2010. On that date, management determines that the asset's salvage value should be $5,000 rather than the original estimate of $10,000. Based on this information, the amount of depreciation expense the company should recognize during the last three months of 2010 would be: 
A. $2,187.50
B. $1,718.75
C. $2,031.25
D. $2,321.43
E. $1,964.29
The asset's book value is $70,000 after having been depreciated for two full years. To calculate the new rate of depreciation, subtract the revised salvage value of $5,000 from the current book value of $70,000, yielding $65,000 of revised remaining depreciable cost. Since that amount is to be recognized over the remaining eight years of useful life, depreciation expense for the last quarter of 2010 would be $2,031.25 [(65,000/8) x 3/12 = $2,031.25].

Short Answer Questions
 
139. Define plant assets and identify the four primary issues in accounting for them. 
Plant assets are tangible assets used in the operations of a company that have a useful life of more than one accounting period. The four main accounting issues include (1) computing their costs, (2) allocating their costs against revenues during the periods they benefit, (3) accounting for expenditures such as repairs and improvements, (4) and recording their disposal.

140. What is depreciation of plant assets? What are the factors to consider in computing depreciation? 
Depreciation is the process of allocating to expense the cost of a plant asset to expense in the accounting periods benefiting from its use. Three factors determine depreciation: cost of the asset, salvage value, and useful life. In addition, the company must determine the depreciation method to use.

141. What are some of the variables that make a plant asset's useful life difficult to predict? 
There are several factors that make it difficult to predict an asset's useful life. A major variable is the wear and tear for the asset's use in operations. Inadequacy, the insufficient capacity of a company's plant assets to meet the company's growing productive demands, is second factor. Obsolescence, the issue of a plant asset that is no longer useful in producing goods and services, is a third factor. Both inadequacy and obsolescence are difficult to predict because the timing of demand changes, new inventions, and improvements is unknown.

142. Explain the purpose of and method of depreciation for partial years. 
Partial years' depreciation is often required because assets are bought and sold throughout the year. Depreciation for assets owned for less than one year is commonly calculated as the annual depreciation prorated for the number of months the assets are owned during the year. This is done so that the year of purchase or the year of disposal is charged with its share of the asset's depreciation.

143. Explain the impact, if any, on depreciation when estimates that determine depreciation change. 
Depreciation is revised when changes in estimates such as salvage value and useful life occur. If the asset's useful life and/or salvage value changes, the remaining depreciable cost is allocated over the remaining revised useful life of the asset. The new estimate is used to compute depreciation for current and future periods.

144. Compare the different depreciation methods (straight-line, units-of-production, and double-declining-balance) with respect to the computation of depreciation per period and the total depreciation over the life of the asset. 
The amount of depreciation expense per period is usually different for different methods. Yet total depreciation expense over the life of the asset is the same for all methods. Specifically, the straight-line method yields the same amount of depreciation for each accounting period. The units-of-production method results in depreciation expense that increases or decreases with the amount of asset usage. The double-declining-balance method is an accelerated method and yields more depreciation expense in the earlier years of ownership than straight-line depreciation.

145. Explain how to calculate total asset turnover. Describe what it reveals about a company's financial condition, whether a higher or lower ratio is desirable, and how it is best applied for comparative purposes. 
Total asset turnover is calculated by dividing net sales by average total assets. The result is interpreted as the amount of net sales generated by each dollar of assets. Thus, the ratio reflects a company's ability to use its assets to generate sales. A high number is desirable; however, it must be interpreted in comparison with prior years as well as with competitors and industry standards.

146. How is the cost principle applied to plant assets, acquisitions, including lump-sum purchases? 
Plant assets should be recorded at cost when acquired. Cost includes all normal and reasonable expenditures necessary to get the asset in place and ready for its intended use. The cost of a lump-sum purchase is allocated among its individual assets based on their relative market (or estimated) values.

147. Explain (in detail) how to compute each of the following depreciation methods: straight-line, units-of-production, and double-declining-balance. 
Straight-line depreciation is calculated by subtracting salvage value from the cost of the plant asset and then dividing the result by the useful life. When useful life is measured in years, the resulting amount is the annual depreciation expense for the asset.
Units-of-production depreciation is calculated by subtracting salvage value from the cost of the plant asset and then dividing the result by the useful life in units. The resulting amount is the depreciation expense per unit. That amount is multiplied by the number of units produced during each accounting period to determine the total amount of depreciation expense for that period.
The double-declining-balance method uses twice the straight-line rate (100%/useful life in years) multiplied by the beginning-of-period book value of the asset. The resulting amount is the depreciation expense for that period.

148. Explain the difference between revenue expenditures and capital expenditures and how they are recorded in the accounting system. 
Revenue expenditures do not materially increase an asset's life or productive capabilities. An example is ordinary repairs where benefits expire in the current accounting period. Revenue expenditures are debited to expense and are thus matched with current revenues.
Capital expenditures make a plant asset more productive or extend its useful life. Examples are extraordinary repairs and betterments that benefit future periods. Capital expenditures are debited to asset accounts and are matched with future periods through depreciation expense.
Immaterial (low cost) long-term expenditures are treated as current period expenses.

149. What are the general accounting procedures for recording asset disposals? 
The first step in the accounting process for asset disposals is to bring the amount of depreciation up to date. The second step is to then remove the cost of the asset and its related accumulated depreciation from the accounting records. The third step is to recognize the amount of cash and/or other assets involved in the transaction. Fourth, record any gain or loss from the asset disposal by comparing the asset book value to the market value of any asset received. Exceptions to the fourth step are exchanges without commercial substance exchange. No gain or loss is recorded for exchanges without commercial substance.

150. Describe the accounting for natural resources, including their acquisition, cost allocation, and account titles. 
The costs of natural resources are recorded as assets. Depletion is the process of allocating the cost of a natural resource to the period when it is consumed. Depletion is calculated by subtracting salvage value from cost and then dividing the result by the expected total unit production of the resource. The resulting amount is depletion expense per unit. The depletion per unit is multiplied by total units for the period to calculate the depletion expense for that period. Total depletion is carried in an accumulated depletion account. Natural resources are reported on the balance sheet at their cost minus accumulated depletion.

136. Describe how to account for and report on contingent liabilities. 
If an uncertain obligation depends on a probable future event arising from a past transaction and the amount is reasonably estimated, the payment is recorded as a liability. If the future event is remote, the item is not recorded or disclosed. If the future event is reasonably possible, the information about the contingent liability is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

139. Explain how to calculate times interest earned. Explain how it is used to analyze a company's risk. 
The times interest earned ratio is calculated by dividing a company's net income before interest expense and income taxes by interest expense. The ratio reflects a company's ability to pay interest and earn a profit for its owners against declines in sales. A low ratio indicates that the default risk on liabilities is high.

140. What is a short-term note payable? Explain the accounting issues related to notes payable. 
A note payable is a written promise to pay a specified amount on a definite future date within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer. Short-term notes payable are negotiable, and can be transferred from party to party. Notes payable must be recorded on the date they are signed. When the note is paid, interest is paid in addition to the principal amount. If the end of the accounting period occurs between the signing of a note payable and its maturity date, the matching principle requires that accrued but unpaid interest be recorded.

141. Explain the responsibilities of and the accounting by employers for employee payroll deductions. 
Employers are responsible for collecting employee federal income taxes and employee social security and Medicare taxes from employees. The employers record these amounts as current liabilities and send the amounts to the federal government to discharge their obligation. Payroll deductions can also include nontax items such as insurance and contributions to retirement plans. All payroll deductions are considered to be liabilities until the amounts are transmitted to the designated organization.

142. Identify and explain the types of employer payroll taxes. 
Employers are required to make matching contributions for the amount of FICA taxes for Social Security and Medicare that are withheld from employees' pay. In addition, employers must contribute to both federal and state unemployment compensation programs. The federal program is called FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) and the state programs are called SUTA (State Unemployment Tax Act). The amount of unemployment tax that employers pay is based on their merit rating. The merit rating reflects a company's stability or instability in employing workers.

143. What are estimated liabilities? Cite at least two examples and explain why they are classified as estimated liabilities. 
Estimated liabilities are known obligations of an uncertain amount that can be estimated. Warranties, income taxes, and employee benefits are common types of estimated liabilities. Warranties are estimated liabilities because the obligation to repair defective merchandise exists at the time of sale. The amount of potential warranty work can be estimated based on past sales. Employee benefits are generated as employees earn their wages. Amounts can be estimated based on contractual or past experience.

103. What are controlling accounts and subsidiary ledgers? What is the relationship between them? 
The controlling accounts are part of the general ledger. Details on individual accounts such as accounts receivable are kept in their own specific subsidiary ledger. The balance in the controlling account must match the sum of the balances in the matching subsidiary ledger. The use of subsidiary ledgers removes unnecessary details from the general ledger.

106. Describe the posting process for special journals. 
Posting to special journals is a three-step process: (1) individual amounts in the Other Accounts column are posted to their general ledger accounts on a regular basis, (2) individual amounts in a column that are posted in total to a controlling account at the end of a period are posted regularly to the appropriate account in the subsidiary ledger, and (3) total amounts for all columns except the Other Accounts column are posted at the end of a period to their appropriate accounts for each column.

107. Explain how the amounts in the subsidiary ledgers are tested for accuracy. 
The two-step procedure begins after the posting process is complete. First, a trial balance of the general ledger is prepared to confirm the equality of debits and credits. Second, schedules are prepared for each subsidiary ledger to verify that the controlling account balances (from the general ledger) equal the balances in their matching subsidiary ledgers.

235. Shawn Nelson, owner of LoveSac, made a decision to open a retail store in a local mall. He signed a three-month lease. His goal was to sell one Sac per day and this would cover his rent and allow him and his cousin to receive a $10 hourly wage. Identify the risk and return for Shawn. 
Shawn may not sell one Sac per day and he and his cousin would have to give up their $10 hourly wage and if sales are not enough to cover the monthly lease payments Shawn will have to seek some type of financing. On the other hand, sales could meet or exceed his expectations and the risk is nullified. The return is that Shawn would be able to pay the lease, pay the wages and expand his business.

 1. In August, a check for $500 was written to Wee Day Care Center. This amount represents child care for her son Brandon.
 2. Cathy plans a Going Out of Business Sale for May, since she will be closing her business for a month-long vacation in June. She plans to reopen July 1 and will continue operating Cathy's Antiques indefinitely.
 3. Cathy received a shipment of pine furniture from Quebec, Canada. The invoice was stated in Canadian dollars.
 4. Joseph Clark paid $1,500 for a dining table. The amount was recorded as revenue. The table will be delivered to Mr. Clark in six weeks.  
 1. Business entity principle. Cathy Miller should refund the $500 to the business or record it as a withdrawal. In the future, she should use a personal check to pay for day care.
2. Going-concern principle. Cathy's Antiques is not going out of business. The business is just closing for vacation. She should hold an inventory reduction sale or other appropriate sale.
3. Monetary unit principle. The invoice should be restated in U.S. dollars for accounting purposes.
4. Revenue recognition principle. Since the table has not been delivered, revenue should not be recognized. The $1,500 should be placed in an account such as Deposits Received from Customers (a type of unearned revenue) until the table is delivered.

111. At the beginning of the current year, Taunton Company's total assets were $248,000 and its total liabilities were $175,000. During the year, the company reported total revenues of $93,000, total expenses of $76,000 and owner withdrawals of $5,000. There were no other changes in owner's capital during the year and total assets at the end of the year were $260,000. Taunton Company's debt ratio at the end of the current year is: 
A. 70.6%.
B. 67.3%.
C. 32.7%.
D. 48.6%.
E. Cannot be determined from the information provided.
If total assets were $248,000 and total liabilities were $175,000, total equity was $73,000 at the beginning of the period. Add to that figure $93,000 of revenues during the year and subtract $76,000 of expenses and $5,000 of withdrawals during the year and equity obviously ended the year at $85,000. If total assets at the end of the year were $260,000 and total equity was $85,000, total liabilities were $175,000. Thus, the debt ratio was $175,000 / $260,000 = 67.3%.

Short Answer Questions
 
139. List the steps in processing transactions. 
Business transactions and events are the starting point. Source documents are analyzed for the effects of the transactions and events on the accounting records. The information is recorded into the journal. The information is then posted to the accounts and a trial balance is prepared. The final step is the preparation of financial statements and reports for decision makers.

143. Explain debits and credits and their role in the accounting system. 
Debit refers to the left side of an account and credit refers to the right side of an account. Debits and credits are part of the double-entry accounting system. This system is based on the concept that all transactions and events affect at least two accounts. The double entry system is organized around the accounting equation which states that assets = liabilities + equity. Assets and expenses have normal debit balances, and liabilities, owner's equity and revenues have normal credit balances

144. Explain the debt ratio and its use in analyzing a company's financial condition. 
The debt ratio is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total assets. It reveals the percentage of the company's assets that are financed by creditors. The higher the ratio, the more risk a company has in trying to repay the debt with interest.

145. Explain the recording and posting processes. 
Information from business transactions and events is recorded in the journal in the form of journal entries. The journal entries include the date, the account titles, and debit and credit amounts. Journal entries may also include a further description of the transaction. During the posting process the debit and credit amounts recorded in the journal are transferred to the individual accounts in the ledger.

146. What is a trial balance? What is its purpose? 
The trial balance is a list of all of the accounts in the ledger with balances at a point in time. The list is organized by debit and credit balances. The purpose of the trial balance is to summarize the account totals and to verify the accuracy of the total debits and credits. If the total debits and credits are not equal, then the trial balance is out of balance which indicates an error in the accounting records. However, even if debits do equal credits this is no guarantee that no errors were made in recording and posting transactions.

147. Describe the link between the income statement, the statement of owner's equity, and the balance sheet. 
The income statement shows the amount of net income the company has earned. That income is carried to the statement of owner's equity. The net income is added to the beginning owner's equity, and owner's withdrawals are subtracted to determine the ending owner's equity. The ending owner's equity is then carried to the balance sheet.
