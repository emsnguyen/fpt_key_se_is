XML gives you a way of packaging your data, and it's taken off largely because XML documents are text | which has meant that you can send them using the existing Internet framework, as built for HTML.
Notes, working drafts, candidate recommendations | and recommendations
An XML element is the basic data-holding construct in an XML document | It starts with an opening tag, can contain text or other elements, and ends with a closing tag, like this: <greeting>hello</greeting>
An attribute gives you more information, and is always assigned a quoted value in XML. | Here's how you might add an attribute named language to this element: <greeting language = "en">hello</greeting>.
he ones we discussed today are that an XML document must contain one or more elements. One element, the root element, must contain all the other elements. | Finally, each element must nest inside any enclosing elements correctly.
All XML processors are supposed to implement at least the UTF-8 (compressed Unicode) and UTF-16 (compressed UCS) character encodings | In practice, you can only count on UTF-8, however
You can escape < and > like this: <message>This is a &lt;message&gt; | element.</message>
A prolog can contain XML declarations, XML comments (which describe the XML document) | processing instructions, whitespace, and doctype declaration(s).
The attributes you can use in an XML document are: version (required; the XML version), encoding (optional; the character encoding), and standalone (optional; "yes" | if the document does not refer to any external documents or entities, "no" otherwise).
There are no processing instructions built into XML already, although some, like <?xml-stylesheet?> | have been generally agreed upon by browser manufacturers.
One. You need at least a root element for an XML document | to be well-formed
In a well-formed XML document, there must be one root element that contains | all the others.
he attribute values are not enclosed in | quotation marks.
You could use this attribute xmlns:service="http://www.superduperbigco.com/customer_service" in an element | After using this attribute, you can use the service prefix in the current element and any child elements.
Use this attribute in the enclosing element | xmlns="http://www.superduperbigco.com/customer_returns"
The <hiredate> and <name> elements are | not declared in the DTD
The <hiredate> and <name> elements appear | in the wrong order.
This DTD uses a choice for the <employee> element, and the choice says that the document can contain | either <hiredate> elements or <name> elements—but not both.
The DTD says there can be at most one <employee> element | but there are two
This XML document references an external DTD, so the XML declaration's standalone attribute should be set to "no". | There may also be errors in the external DTD, of course.
You can use the #IMPLIED keyword | address CDATA #IMPLIED
You can use the #FIXED keyword. | name CDATA #REQUIRED
The namespace that is used by XML schemas is | www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema
You can declare elements by using <xsd:element> | and attributes by using <xsd:attribute>
You can declare the element like this | <xsd:element name="name" type="xsd:string"/>
You can do this in an XML schema: | <xsd:attribute name="language" type="xsd:string" use="optional"/>.
You use the <xsd:restriction> element | and the base attribute.
To cap values, you can use the maxIncusive and maxExclusive facets. | To constrain values to be one of a set, you can use the enumeration facet.
You can use this CSS property/value pair: font-size: 36pt | You can use this CSS property/value pair: display: block
You can use this CSS property/value pair: text-align: center | You can use this CSS property/value pair: text-decoration: underline.  You can use this CSS property/value pair: margin-top: 10.
* by itself applied to ch09_01.xml just picks out the <states> element. * selects all element children (not grandchildren or any descendents) | of the context node, and when you open ch09_01.xml, the root node is the context node.
The XPath expression //* selects all elements in | ch09_01.xml
The first XSL-FO element you must use in an XSL-FO document is | the <fo:root> element.
The <fo:root> element can contain both a master set layout | and page sequences.
The <fo:region-before> element. | The line-height attribute.
The master-reference attribute | abcdef
The three versions of XHTML 1.0 are XHTML 1.0 Transitional, XHTML 1.0 Frameset, and XHTML 1.0 Strict. | .
The namespace is ">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml". | .
This is a trick question. You can't use standalone attributes in XHTML. Every attribute must be assigned a quoted value. | .
In XHTML, every XHTML document must have a <head> element, and every <head> element must contain at least a <title> element. | .
Every <p> element needs a closing tag, </p>. | .
You need to use either the href or id attribute in the <a> element. | .
The src and alt attributes are required. | .
The <frameset> and <frame> elements are supported in XHTML 1.0 Frameset only. | .
The W3C suggests that you use style sheets instead of the <frame> and <frameset> elements. To replace frames, you can often use a <div> element and position it where you want it. | .
The <table> element is supported in both XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1. | .
The height and width attributes are required. | .
The r attribute is required. | .
Here's one example: <polyline points="0,0 100,100 200,0/> | >
You can use this command: "M200,300". | .
You can use the <img> element's region attribute to specify a region that is defined in the <layout> element. | .
The possible values you can assign to the xlink:type attribute, which sets the type of the XLink, are "simple", "extended", "locator", "arc", "resource", "title", and "none". | .
The xlink:type attribute is required in every XLink. | .
You can set the xlink:show attribute to "replace". | .
You use the <xforms:model> element to specify how an XForm's data should be structured. | .
You can use XML like this: <xforms:instance>     <data xmlns="">         <input>Hello!</input>     </data> </xforms:instance> | .
You also need to set the ref attribute of the input control to "/data/input". | .
You can use the nextChild method to move to the next child node. | .
You can use the nodeValue property to get a node's value. | .
You can call xmlDocumentObject.getElementsByTagName("senator") to get a list of all the <senator> elements in a document. | .
To get a named node map of an element's attributes, you simply use the element's attributes property. | .
In Java 1.4 or later, you can use a Java DocumentBuilderFactory object to create a DocumentBuilder object. Then you can use the DocumentBuilder object's parse method to parse an XML document and create a Java Document object. | .
You can use the node's getNodeType method and check the results it returns against fields such as Node.ELEMENT_NODE, Node.TEXT_NODE, and so on. | .
You can use the getNodeName method to get a node's name and its getNodeValue method to get its value. | .
You can call a Document object's getElementsByTagName method like this: document.getElementsByTagName("senator") | .
You can create the <child> element by using a Document object's createElement method, create the text in it by using the | .
createTextNode method, append the text node to the <child> element by using the element's appendChild method, and append | .
the <child> element to the <element> element by using the <child> element's appendChild method | .
In Java 1.4 or later, you can derive a class from a SAX handler class, such as DefaultHandler, and then use a | .
SAXParserFactory object to create a new SAX factory. You create a SAX parser by using the SAXParserFactory object, call its | .
parse method, and implement the SAX methods you want (for example, the startElement method) | .
You can implement the startElement and endElement methods to catch the starting and closing tags of elements | .
You can implement the characters method and extract the text node's text from the character array passed to you, using the | .
starting position in the array. The length of the text is also passed to you | .
You can use the Attributes object passed to the startElement method to handle an element's attributes. | .
You use methods such as the warning method to handle warnings, the error method to handle errors, and the fatalError method to handle fatal errors. | .
The three parts of a SOAP message are the envelope, header, and body. | .
The <Header>, <Body>, and <Fault> elements are the three child elements you can use in a SOAP envelope. | .
You set the element's mustUnderstand attribute to "1". | .
You use the <Description> element. | .
A good choice would be the <Contributor> element. | .
You can create an XML island that makes the XML data in a document named data.xml available as a DSO named data by using this HTML element: | <XML SRC="data.xml" ID="data"></XML>
DATASRC and DATAFLD are the two HTML attributes you normally use to bind an HTML control to a DSO. | .
One way is to use the DATASRC attribute of the <TABLE> element to connect to a DSO and the DATAFLD attribute of a <SPAN> element in each <TD> element. | .
You can use the dso .recordset.BOF and dso .recordset.EOF properties, where dso is the name of the DSO. | .
You can access it as dso .recordset("address"), where dso is the name of the DSO | .
You use the Fill method | .
You can use the WriteXml and ReadXml methods. | .
Here's one solution: let $name := local-name($elem) | .
You can use the expression $elem/@*. | .
Here's one way to do it: define global $data {treat as document data (glx:document-validate("data.xml", "document"))} | .
You can select Project, Add Item in Visual Studio .NET to open the Add new Item dialog box. Then you select the XML File | template in the Templates box, give the new document a name, and click the Open button.
You use the WriteStartElement method. | .
You can check the XMLTextReader object's NodeType property, which you can compare to fields such as XmlNodeType.XmlDeclaration and XmlNodeType.ProcessingInstruction. | .
To expose methods from a Web service and make them accessible outside the service, you use the <WebMethod()> attribute. | .
You need to add to the Windows application a Web reference to the Web service, and you need to create an object corresponding to that service. Then you can call the Web service's members by using that object. | .
